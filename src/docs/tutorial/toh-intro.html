  <p>The Tour of Heroes app covers the core fundamentals of Angular.
    You'll build a basic app that has many of the features
    you'd expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven app: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing a selected
    hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.

<p>You'll learn enough core Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do. You'll
  cover a lot of ground at an introductory level, and you'll find many links to pages with greater depth.
