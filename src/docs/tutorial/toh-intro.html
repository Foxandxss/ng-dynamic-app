<h1 id="tutorial-tour-of-heroes">Tour of Heroes Tutorial</h1>
<p>The grand plan for this tutorial is to build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.
</p>

<awesome>
<p>The Tour of Heroes app covers the core fundamentals of Angular. You'll build a basic app that has many of the features
  you'd expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven app: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing a selected
  hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.
</p>
</awesome>

<p>You'll learn enough core Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do. You'll
  cover a lot of ground at an introductory level, and you'll find many links to pages with greater depth.
