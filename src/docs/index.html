<h1>DocViewer Home</h1>

<p>
  This project's <i>DocViewer</i> presents several free-form HTML pages with
  Angular components <i>embedded</i> arbitrarily within those pages.
</p>

<p>
Each page, located in the <code>/docs</code> folder and linked to on the left,
illustrates a particular solution to a particular component presentation problem.
</p><p>
The pages are (mostly) ordered from simple to complex.
</p><p>
  The <a href="long-story" title="The long story about Angular Dynamic Content">long story</a> attempts to explain the Angular Dynamic Content project
  in detail.
</p><p>
The <i>embedded component</i> demonstration begins right here, on this page,
with the <code>FortuneCookieComponent</code>.
<aside>
  I opened your fortune cookie and it said, "<i><fortune></fortune></i>"
