<h1>Hero Form</h1>

<p>We can embed a form in an arbitrary position on the page.</p>

<hero-form></hero-form>

<p>
  Notice the <i>required</i> field validations.
  Try erasing the name.
  See what happens when you click "Submit" or "New Hero".
</p><p>
  Imagine the data access and business logic that could lie behind this form component.
</p><p>
  With a bit more work, we could create a form design experience in which the user dragged a form glyph from a "toolbox" onto a "dashboard canvas" and the app generated
  the metadata to drive an experience like this.
